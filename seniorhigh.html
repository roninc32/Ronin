	<h1>Senior High School</h1>
		<p class="p3"> <img src="seniorhigh.jpg" alt="avatar">Senior year of high school, the year that every person under the age of 18 longs for. I can remember mine vividly. The colors maroon and black and white were everywhere throughoutour spirit filled halls. Usually most people would be able to remember there’s for positive reasons. Now don’t get me wrong, I did have a good high school experience; however this isn’t about the good times I had. I want to tell you a story about something else. A real life lesson that I learned in school, something truly beneficial to my future. My senior year of high school taught me many things, however nothing compared to what I learned when I hit rock bottom that year.</p>
